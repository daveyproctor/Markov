## Markov Chain
* Markov.py
* Base class for a Markov chain.
* Can simulate random games and determine game statistics. See Chutes and Ladders.

## Page Rank
* page_rank.py
* Google page rank algorithm with visual for handful of web pages.

## Wifi Reception
* wifi_reception_model.ipynb
* Simulates receiver nodes needing to both receive reception from a source before we count it as successful

## Chutes and Ladders
* chutes_ladders.py
* Treats simple chutes and ladders game as a Markov chain and analyzes game statistics.

## Visualize
* graphVizWrapper.py
* For viewing graphs with graphviz library.
